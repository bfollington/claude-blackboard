This project maintains a living domain model in `.knowledge/domain/` as structured YAML files. Propose changes to the domain model. Think through:

1. **Language**: What terms best capture this concept? Are we using domain language or accidentally slipping into technical language?

2. **Boundaries**: Which existing concepts are affected? Are we expanding a concept's responsibilities or do we need something new? Where do the boundaries fall?

3. **Analogies**: What real-world pattern does this match? How does that analogy guide the structure?

4. **Relationships**: How does this connect to existing concepts? Are those connections clear and necessary?

5. **Clarity**: Does this make the model easier to understand or are we papering over fuzzy thinking?

Make the changes to YAML files. Flag any places where the domain thinking seems unclear - those are opportunities to sharpen our understanding.
